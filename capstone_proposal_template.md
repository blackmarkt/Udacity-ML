## Is Bitcoin Price Predictable? ## 

### Domain Background
references: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bitcoin

***What is a Bitcoin?***
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that was designed as a digital payments processing system that relies on crytography in order to secure transactions. There is much mythology built around Bitcoin's creation and it's creator Satoshi Nakamoto who in late 2008 authored the white paper "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System". Bitcoin's technological revolution is it's blockchain technology where all transactions including the creation of new bitcoins are stored and verified. Since 2008 countless cryptocurrencies known as [Altcoins](http://www.businessinsider.com/list-top-cryptocurrencies-analysis-comparison-2017-10) have emerged in the space such as Ethereum and Litecoin. Over the past couple of year Bitcoin has skyrocketed from obscurity into mainstream as it's price continues it's meteoric rise with many calling this rapid ascension a "bubble". Recently the CBOE and CME offered Bitcoin futures for trading signally the cryptocurrecncy's legitimacy as an tradeable asset.

Is Bitcoin a "bubble"? Is it here to stay? Will global Central Banks and governments wipe out Bitcoin holders? These are the central questions that plague crytocurrencies today in their nascent stage. These questions are central for investors and potential investors who are trying to assess the long-term structural risks inherent in new asset classes. 

From a trading standpoint the above questions are not as interesting as trying to determine whether shorter-term opportunities exist in the price movements of assets. This proposal is concerned with the questions:

***Is the price of Bitcoin predictable?***

***Can we use Machine Learning to aid us in understanding and possibly forecasting the price of cryptocurrencies***

In this section, provide brief details on the background information of the domain from which the project is proposed. Historical information relevant to the project should be included. It should be clear how or why a problem in the domain can or should be solved. Related academic research should be appropriately cited in this section, including why that research is relevant. Additionally, a discussion of your personal motivation for investigating a particular problem in the domain is encouraged but not required.

### Problem Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe the problem that is to be solved. The problem described should be well defined and should have at least one relevant potential solution. Additionally, describe the problem thoroughly such that it is clear that the problem is quantifiable (the problem can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the problem can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the problem can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Datasets and Inputs
_(approx. 2-3 paragraphs)_

**Datasets**
Quandl Bitcoin Markets [bitstampUSD](https://www.quandl.com/data/BCHARTS/BITSTAMPUSD-Bitcoin-Markets-bitstampUSD) 

In this section, the dataset(s) and/or input(s) being considered for the project should be thoroughly described, such as how they relate to the problem and why they should be used. Information such as how the dataset or input is (was) obtained, and the characteristics of the dataset or input, should be included with relevant references and citations as necessary It should be clear how the dataset(s) or input(s) will be used in the project and whether their use is appropriate given the context of the problem.

### Solution Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Benchmark Model
_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.

### Evaluation Metrics
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).

### Project Design
_(approx. 1 page)_

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.
